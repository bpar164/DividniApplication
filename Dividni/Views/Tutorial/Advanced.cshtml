                        <li>Fill-in the question name (letters and numbers only; starting with a letter). The question
                            name needs to be the same in 3 places (otherwise the question will not show-up on the
                            assessment):</li>

                    <p>
                        <li>Next, enter the question type. This can be 'TruthQuestion' or 'XyzQuestion'.
                            See the <a asp-controller="Tutorial" asp-action="Simple" target="_blank">simple tutorial
                                <i class="tiny material-icons">open_in_new</i></a> for an explanation of these types.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>The 'q.marks' variable is a positive integer value representing the question's mark count.
                            Do not put any quotation marks around this value.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>The next step is to write some code to generate the correct/incorrect answers.

                            Alternatively, video tutorials can be found on <a

                            You can write comments in C# (code/text that is ignored when the code is compiled) by adding // in front of a line, 
                            or by using /* */ for multi-line comments.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>Complete the question text inbetween the quotation marks in the 'q.stem' field.
                            You will usually include some of the values used in calculating the answers in this text.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>The 'q.AddCorrects()' and 'q.AddIncorrects()' variables are for holding lists of answers
                            (separated by commas).
                            Most of these will include values from the code you have written.
                            Remember to include at least the minimum required number of answers for the chosen question type: Truth
                            requires 1 correct and 4 incorrect answers, whilst XYZ requires 3 correct and 3 incorrect
                            answers. <b>All of the answers for the question must be unique</b>.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>Once you are done, click on the <b>TEST</b> button to compile the code. 
                        A dialog will pop-up to display any errors encountered when compiling the code.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        <li>If there are no errors, there will be a <b>GENERATE</b> button that you can click on to save the question.
                            You will then be redirected to the management page. If you close the dialog without generating the question, 
                            you will need to test it again as this process has to be performed before saving the code.
                        </li>

            <img src="~/images/advancedExample.png">
            <h5 class="teal-text">Managing your Questions</h5>
            <p>The <a asp-controller="Advanced" asp-action="Index" target="_blank">advanced question management <i
                        class="tiny material-icons">open_in_new</i></a> page displays all of the advanced questions that
                you have
                created/that have been shared with you.
            </p>
            <p>The questions are sorted newest to oldest by default (you can also sort by name), and you can search for
                a question by name.</p>
            <p>(The <i class="material-icons">link</i> icon next to each question's name copies that question's id to
                the clipboard. This is only used when creating an assessment.)</p>
            <p>You can click on the icons next to each question to perform a number of actions (which will open
                a new page):</p>
            <h6 class="teal-text">Viewing a Question <i class="material-icons">pageview</i></h6>
            <p>Displays all of the question details. The code editor is set to read-only mode.</p>
            <h6 class="teal-text">Editing a Question <i class="material-icons">edit</i></h6>
            <p>Loads the question code into the code editor. You will need to follow the same test/generate process as
                when creating the question, to save any changes.</p>
            <h6 class="teal-text">Deleting a Question <i class="material-icons">delete</i></h6>
            <p>The question details are displayed before you confirm the deletion. The code editor is set to read-only
                mode.</p>
            <h6 class="teal-text">Using a Question as a Template <i class="material-icons">content_copy</i>
            </h6>
            <p>Loads the question code into the code editor. The question must be tested/generated
                before exiting.</p>
            <p>Note that using a question as a template creates a new question and leaves the original unchanged.</p>
            <h6 class="teal-text">Sharing a Question <i class="material-icons">share</i></h6>
            <p>The code editor is set to read-only mode.</p>
            <p>An input for the user's email is displayed underneath the question details.</p>
            <p>The user must have an account before you are able to share questions with him/her.</p>
            <p>The user receives a copy of the question and cannot make any changes to the original.</p>
            <h6 class="teal-text">Add to Question Bank <i class="material-icons">playlist_add</i></h6>
            <p>A dropdown list will appear displaying all of your question banks. Click on a name to add the question to
                that question bank.</p>
            <p>You can add a question to the same question bank multiple times, but it will only be listed once.</p>
            <p>Question banks can be managed on the <a asp-controller="QuestionBank" asp-action="Index"
