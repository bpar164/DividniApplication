                        <li>Fill-in the exam name (text, numbers, and dashes only. Please use dashes instead of spaces).
                            This is to
                            help you identify the exam later.

                    <p>
                        <li>Next, enter the number of versions of the exam (paper count) that you want to generate. This
                            value can
                            be between 1 and 100.</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>Check the cover page box to create an editor window for the exam cover page. This section
                            can contain
                            formatting, and is optional.</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>The questions section will list all of your created questions. Check the box next to a
                            question to
                            include it in the exam.
                            Clicking on the <i class="tiny material-icons">zoom_in </i> icon will display the question

                    <p>
                        <li>Instruction sections are essentially questions without answers. As the name suggests, they
                            can be used
                            for writing instructions for a subset of the questions.
                            Click on the <i class="tiny material-icons">add_circle</i> icon to create an editor window
                            for a new
                            instruction section.
                            You can write the section (formatting is allowed) and click on the save button to add the
                            section to your
                            questions. It will be included in the exam automatically.
                            Unchecking the section will prevent it from being included in the exam. Previewing works the
                            same as with
                            regular questions.
                            You can also click on the <i class="tiny material-icons">edit</i> icon to make changes to
                            the section.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        </p>Re-order the questions and instruction sections by clicking and dragging them into the order
                        you would
                        like them to appear in on the exam.</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>Check the appendix box to create an editor window for the appendix. This section can contain
                            formatting,
                            and is optional.</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>Click the <b>PREVIEW</b> button to see a preview of the exam.
                            If you are happy with the exam, you can click on <b>GENERATE</b> to create the exam.
                            Otherwise, you can still make changes and click on <b>PREVIEW</b> to view the modified exam.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>Clicking the <b>GENERATE</b> button will bring up a window with a list of the available exam
                            types.
                            See the next section for an explanation of these types.
                            Make a selection and click on <b>SELECT</b> to generate the exam. This may take a minute or
                            so.
                            The window will display the outcome of the action. If there was a problem, you will be able
                            to modify the
                            exam details and try again.
                            If the exam generated multiple versions of the paper (e.g. the paper count was greater than
                            one and the
                            exam type was standard),
                            you can click on the <b>Merge PDFs?</b> button. This will create a combined pdf of all of
                            the different
                            versions of the exam, for ease of printing.
                            The final step is to click on <b>Download Exam</b>. The exam will download as a .zip file.
                            See the <i>Exam .zip File Contents</i> section for an explanation of this file.
                            You will then have the options to create another exam, or view all of the exams that you
                            have created.
                        </li>
                    </p>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <h5 class="teal-text">Exam Types</h5>
            <p>When generating an exam, the final step is to choose the exam type:</p>
            <p>Selecting <i>standard</i> will create the desired number of papers in pdf format.
                The generated exams will incorporate any of the following if present: the cover page, appendix, and
                instruction
                sections.
            </p>
            <p>Selecting any of the learning management system options will generate a zip file (using the exam name),
                that
                can be imported into the corresponding system.
                At present these options DO NOT allow instruction sections to be included in the exam, so these will be
                ignored.
            </p>
            <h5 class="teal-text">Exam .zip File Contents</h5>
            <p>Every type of exam downloads as a single .zip folder, which will have the name given to the exam when it
                was
                created. Extract the contents to start.</p>
            <p>For <i>standard</i> exams, the folder will consist of two subfolders and some files.
                The <i>answers</i> folder contains text files with the solutions to each version of the exam.
                The <i>papers</i> folder will contain pdfs of each version of the exam, and a combined version (it will
                have the
                same name as the exam), if it was generated.
                Most users will not need any of the other files in the main folder or any of the non-pdf files in the
                <i>papers</i> folder. These can be deleted.
            </p>
            <p>For learning management system exams (except Moodle), the folder will contain some files and another .zip
                folder with the same
                name as the exam.
                This second .zip folder can be uploaded to the learning management system to create an exam.
                The other files can be ignored or deleted.
            </p>
            <p>For Moodle exams, the folder will contain files and another regular folder with the same
                name as the exam.
                This second folder can be uploaded to Moodle to create an exam.
                The other files can be ignored or deleted.
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>You can click on the icons next to each assessment to perform a number of actions (which will open

            <p>Note that using an assessment as a template generates a new assessment and leaves the original unchanged.
            </p>
            <h6 class="teal-text">Sharing an Assessment <i class="material-icons">share</i></h6>
            <p>An input for the user's email is displayed underneath the assessment details.</p>
            <p>The user must have an account before you are able to share assessments with him/her.</p>
            <p>Note that sharing an assessment does not automatically share share the questions in that assessment.
                The other user will be able to view the details of the questions and include them in the assessment, but
                cannot edit them. You will need to share individual questions with the other user if he/she will need to
                make any changes to them.
